Hydras and Hypermedia
=====================

This is a hands-on REST tutorial based on techniques described in [REST in Practice: Hypermedia and Systems Architecture](http://restinpractice.com). 

Over the course of the tutorial you'll build a hypermedia-driven text-based pick-your-path-to-adventure game in .NET using the new [WCF Web APIs](http://wcf.codeplex.com). 

This isn't a tutorial on games design, however. Despite the non-enterprisey subject matter, the tutorial serves to illustrate how machine clients and services can cooperate to achieve a useful application goal. Business application analogies lurk around every corner and surprise you with every encounter.

The tutorial comprises three exercises. With each exercise you'll have to fix a number of broken unit and functional tests. Bit by bit, you'll build a working application:

* __Exercise 1:__ Here we implement the server resources that make up the dungeon - the chambers, tunnels and caves in which our daring client will venture.
* __Exercise 2:__ Next we build a crafty client that can discover a path through the dungeon. By the end of the exercise, the client ought to be able to navigate the dungeon from entrance to exit.
* __Exercise 3:__ Last, we add an element of danger, populating the dungeon with encounters (more resources) that the client must overcome before it achieves its application goal.

Along the way you'll learn about:

* The Atom Syndication Format
* 'What if' client-side intelligence
* The client as arbiter of application state
* Hypermedia controls: links, link relations and forms
* DRY URIs
